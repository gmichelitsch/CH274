    "Our approach to **design a code** to calculate the wave functions and the energies shall be as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) First we have to think carefully about what different building blocks we need. Each of these elements or building blocks could potentially be designed to be an independent piece of code that can be called as often as we want (This is what we call a **function**.) Functions allow us to package and reuse code without having to modify it. Look at the cells in the Recap section to see examples of non-reusable code (sometimes called 'spagetti' code) \n",
    "\n",
    "In the example of the pib1d, we need following building blocks\n",
    "* a function that sets up the box along the $x$ axis (let's call this function ```make_xgrid```)\n",
    "* a function that defines the potential and imposes the boundary condition (let's call this function ```potential```)\n",
    "* a function that sets up the Hamiltonian (let's call this ```create_H```)\n",
    "* a function that diagonalises the SE: $\\hat{H}\\psi = E\\psi $ to give us $E$ and $\\psi$ (```diagonalise_H```)\n",
    "* a function that plots $E(x)$ and $\\psi(x)$ (```generate_plots```)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) Then we need to write and test these 5 functions. **Testing** is essential as it enables us to know which parts of the code operate as intended. Tests that assess the validity of individual functions are oftne called **unit tests**.\n",
    "\n",
    "(3) At the end, when we know that all functions do what they are supposed to do, we write code (can be spagetti code or a function) that executes the functions in the right order. This is typically called the ```main``` or ```program```.\n",
